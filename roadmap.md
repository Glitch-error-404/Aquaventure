# **Roadmap for Water-Saver App**

## **Phase 1: MVP Development**
### Timeline: 4-6 Weeks
1. **Core Functionality**
   - Develop a feature to input daily water usage activities (e.g., shower time, dishwasher use).
   - Build backend logic for water consumption calculations using pre-defined formulas.
   - Display total water consumption in real-time with relatable context (e.g., bathtubs, buckets).

2. **User Interface**
   - Design a simple, intuitive, and visually appealing UI.
   - Add engaging elements like animated water droplets or progress bars.
   - Ensure cross-device compatibility (mobile-first approach).

3. **Basic Features**
   - Create a Suggestions module to provide actionable water-saving tips.
   - Implement a basic progress tracker to monitor daily or weekly water usage trends.
   - Add a Google Login integration for secure, quick user authentication.

## **Phase 2: Enhanced User Experience**
### Timeline: 6-8 Weeks
1. **AI Chatbot**
   - Integrate an AI chatbot to answer user questions and provide personalized water-saving advice.
   - Add pre-programmed responses for common queries related to water conservation.

2. **Advanced Feedback**
   - Include more detailed analysis, like peak water usage times or high-wastage activities.
   - Allow users to set personal goals for water reduction (e.g., reducing shower time by 2 minutes).

3. **Gamification**
   - Introduce badges or rewards for consistent water-saving efforts.
   - Create milestones (e.g., saving enough water to fill 10 bathtubs).

## **Phase 3: Data Insights and Community Features**
### Timeline: 8-12 Weeks
1. **Data Insights**
   - Enable users to compare their water usage to local or national averages.
   - Add graphs and visual summaries to show trends over time.

2. **Community Challenges**
   - Introduce community-based challenges to encourage group water-saving efforts.
   - Allow users to share achievements on social media (optional).

3. **Expansion of Suggestions**
   - Provide more detailed, specific tips based on user behavior.
   - Include seasonal tips (e.g., saving water in summer months).

## **Phase 4: Scalability and Future Features**
### Timeline: 12+ Weeks
1. **Scalable Features**
   - Expand calculations to include family or household water usage.
   - Add support for multiple users under one account.

2. **Localization**
   - Adapt the app for different regions (e.g., local water usage stats, tips based on climate).

3. **Integration**
   - Partner with local water authorities to provide real-time insights.
   - Explore IoT integration (e.g., syncing with smart showerheads or water meters).

## **Technical Details**
1. **Tech Stack**
   - Frontend: React Native for cross-platform compatibility.
   - Backend: Node.js with Express framework.
   - Database: MongoDB for storing user data and progress.
   - AI Chatbot: OpenAI API for personalized responses.

2. **APIs**
   - Google Authentication API for login.
   - OpenWeatherMap API (future) for climate-related suggestions.

3. **Version Control**
   - Use GitHub/GitLab for repository management.
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline for deployment and updates.
